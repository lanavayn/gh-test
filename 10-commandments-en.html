            I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

            You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God,  
            visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Me,

            Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work,  
            but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God.  
            On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant,  
            or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates.  
            For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day.  
            Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

      <h3>Commandment 1 — Interpretation</h3>
      <p><strong>“I am the Lord your God…”</strong> — This is a reminder of God’s personal relationship with His people. He is not a distant deity, but the one who rescued them from slavery and established a covenant with them.</p>
      <p><strong>“Who brought you out of the land of Egypt…”</strong> — This refers to the historical deliverance of Israel from physical bondage, which also symbolizes God’s power to free people from sin and spiritual slavery.</p>
      <p><strong>“You shall have no other gods before Me.”</strong> — This is a call to absolute loyalty. God demands exclusive worship. No person, object, ideology, or desire should take His place in one’s heart.</p>
      <p>This commandment is foundational — it sets the tone for all the others. True worship begins with recognizing and honoring the one true God above all else.</p>
